					<h3> The debate:</h3>
					<div>
						Since the dawn of time, guitarists everywhere have wondered: What is better the Les Paul or the Stratocaster? Both are staples of the rock universe but surely one must be superior.<br>
						<br> The Gibson Les Paul was first released in 1952 after being designed and endorsed by Mr. Les Paul himself. It quickly spread to be mass produced and its versatility allows its use in many genres spreading from jazz to heavy metal.  <br><br>The Fender Stratocaster, or strat, was invented in 1954. Featuring a double cutaway and an iconic top "horn", the guitar is the single best selling guitar to hit the market.<br>

					<h3> The Conclusion:</h3>
					<div>The answer is clear, there can only be one guitar to come out on top of this debate and it is obvious the stratocaster is the clear winner. The Les Paul is no doubt a peice of junk as the validity of this argument was in question since the start.
