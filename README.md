This repository is for my storing my projects from my intro to Computing. The course teaches html, css and javascript basics. For now, the finished projects can be viewed at http://lamp.cse.fau.edu/~nchild2019/ . If the page stops working it is because I have finished the class and my assignments have been removed from the schools server.
